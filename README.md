# PersonalityBot-

a) We need to set up a robot to evaluate personalities and give some snarky verdict. It can only take two parameters for the time being, patience and kindness, which go from 1 to 10. If someone enters an invalid value, the robot collapses and the program ends.

b) If both stats are at the maximum or minimum, the robot is impressed. If neither, the robot is bored.

c) In addition to that, the robot should give a message if both stats have the same value, if patience is higher, and if kindness is higher.
